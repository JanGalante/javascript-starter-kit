//Extract logic to POJO:s (Plain old JavaScript objects).

//POJO:s contains plain logic not tied to any framework. Strive to place as much logic as possiblen in plain JavaScript. Makes it it esier to test and reuse.
//Minimize the effort to change to another framework. Not unrealistic that it might happen in the fast changing JavaScript world.
